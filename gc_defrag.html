<h1>Garbage Collection and Defragmentation</h1>
</center>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<P>
When we study resource allocation in an Operating Systems course, we focus on a few key resources
(like space in main memory and secondary storage).  But the issues and techniques for addressing
those problems apply to a much wider range of divisible, serially reusable resources (e.g. 
farm land or appointments on a calendar), and so are a valuable foundation for all software
developers.  Two non-obvious techniques that have evolved (and been widely applied) over the last
fifty years are:
<ol type="1">
	<li>Garbage Collection ... seeking out no-longer-in-use resources and recycling them
	   for reuse</li>
	<li>Defragmentation ... reassigning and relocating previously allocated resources to 
	    eliminate <em>external fragmentation</em> to create densely allocated resources
	    with large contiguous pools of free space</li>
</ol>
These two techniques are, in principle, orthogonal ...  but we discuss them together for
a few reasons:
<ul>
	<li> both are techniques for remedying space that has been rendered unusable 
	     by unfortunate combinations of allocation events.</li>
	<li> both are active resource management techniques, where the resource
	     manager is continuously engaged in resource use analysis and 
	     reallocation (as opposed to simply responding to client requests).
	<li> they are often applied in tandem ... start with garbage collection,
	     and then perform defragmentation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Garbage Collection</h2>
<P>
How does an allocated resource come to be returned to the free pool?
<ul>
    <li>With many resources, and in many programming languages, allocated resources are
    	freed by an explict or implicit action on the client's part.  Example
	include:
	<ul>
		<li> calling <em>close(2)</em> on a file</li>
		<li> calling <em>free(3)</em> on memory obtained from <em>malloc(3)</em></li>
		<li> invoking the <em>delete</em> operator on a C++ object</li>
		<li> returning from a C/C++ subroutine</li>
		<li>calling <em>exit(2)</em> to terminate a process</li>
	</ul>
   <P>
   </p>
   <li>If a resource is sharable by multiple concurrent clients (e.g. an
       open file or a shared memory segment), we cannot
       free it simply becuase one client called close.
       The resource manager (e.g. the operating system) may maintain a 
       active reference count for each resource:
       <ul>
       		<li> increment the reference count whenever a new 
		     reference to the object is obtained.</li>
		<li> decrement the reference count whenevever a
		     reference is released (e.g. by calling close).</li>
		<li> automatically free the object when the reference
		     count reaches zero.</li>
       </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
But these two approaches are not always practical:
<ul>
	<li> in languages where it is possible to copy resource references (e.g. pointers)
		references can be copied or destroyed without invoking any operating
		system services ... and so the OS will not know about these resource
		references.</li>
	<li> most programming languages seek to make the programmer's job easier, and keeping 
		track of when which resources are no longer needed can be a lot of work.  For
		this reason, many languages (e.g. Lisp, Java, Python) do not require
		programs to explicitly free some resources (e.g. memory).  This not only
		reduces developer task loading, but it also eliminages a great many
		bugs.</li>
	<li> some resources (e.g. DHCP addresses) may never be explicitly freed,
		and so must be automatically recycled after they have gone unused
		for a specified period of time.</li>
	<li> for some resources, allocation/release operations may be so frequent that
		the cost of keeping track of them becomes a significant overhead and
		performance loss.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
In situations like these <em>Garbage Collection</em> is a popular alternative to 
explicit or reference count based freeing.  In such a system ...
<ul>
	<li> resources are allocated, and never explicitly freed </li>
	<li> when the pool of available resources becomes dangerously small, the system initiates 
		garbage collection:
		<ol type="1">
			<li>begin with a list of all of the resources that originally existed.</li>
			<li>scan the process to find all resources that are still reachable.</li>
			<li>each time a reachable resource is found, remove it from the original resource list.</li>
			<li>at the end of the scan, anything that is still in the list of original resouces,
			    is no longer referenced by the process, and can be freed.</li>
			<li>after freeing the unused resources, normal program operation can resume.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
But Garbage Collection only works if it is possible to identify all active resource references.
This might not be possible in an arbitrary program.  We could scan all of memory searching for
pointers into the allocation heap ... but when we find a heap address in memory, we cannot know 
if it is a pointer or merely a bit pattern that resembles a pointer.  And even if it were
clearly a pointer, we cannot know whether or not the program is still going to use it.  In 
languages (or resources) that rely on Garbage Collection the data structures associated with
resource references have been designed to be easily enumerated to enable the scan for accessible
resources.
</P>
<P>
Garbage Collection definitely simplifies the developers job, but (like most things) it comes
at a cost: The system may run very nicely for a long time, and then suddenly stop (at unpredictable
times) for garbage collection.  Clever developers have reduced this problem by creating more
complex progressive background garbage collectors that run (relatively) continuously, so that
continuous resource freeing can keep up with continuous resource allocation.  And, even if
background garbage collection is able to keep up with resource allocation demands, it often
consumes a lot of cycles and must somehow be synchronized with ongoing allocation operations
in the address space it is trying to analyze.

<h2>Defragmentation</h2>
<P>
The second problem to be addressed is <em>external fragmentation</em>.  We observed that
all variable partition memory allocation algorithms eventually result in a loss of useful
storage due to external fragmentation ... the free memory is broken up into disconnected
shards, none of which are large enough to be useful.  In discussing those algorithms, we
observed that coalescing of adjacent free fragments can counter external fragmentation;
But coalescing is only effective if adjacent memory chunks happen to be free at the same
time.  If short-lived allocations are adjacent to a long-lived allocation, or if allocations
and deallocations are extremely frequent, there may be very few such opportunities.
</P>
<P>
How important is contiguous allocation?
<ul>
   <li>	if we are allocating blocks of disk, the only cost of non-contiguous allocation may
        be more and longer seeks, resulting in slower file I/O.</li>
   <li> if we are allocating memory to an application that needs to create a single 1024 byte
        data structure, the program will not work with four discontiguous 256 byte chunks
	of memory.</li>
   <li> Solid State Disks (based on NAND-Flash technology) may allocate space one
        4K block at a time; but before that block can be rewritten with new data
	it must be erased ... and erasure operations might be performed 64MB at a
	time.
</ul>
</P>
<P>
Garbage Collection analyzes the allocated resources to determine which ones are still
in use.  Defragmentation goes farther.  It actually changes which resources are allocated.
Consider two applications of de-fragmentation:
<UL>
   <LI> Flash Management
        <p>
	NAND Flash is a pseudo-Write-Once-Read-Many medium.  After a block has been written,
	some serious processing and voltage will be required to erase it before it can be
	rewritten with new data.  When the operating system does a write to an SSD, 
	firmware in the Flash Controller assigns a new block to receive the new data 
	(leaving the old contents no longer referenced).
	As more and more 4K blocks become stale.  Half of all the blocks in the SSD
	may be available for reuse, but the free blocks are distributed randomly
	throughout memory.
	</p>
	<p>
	To make those blocks writable again, they must first be erased.  But erasure
	can only be done in large (e.g. 64MB units).  Therefore we must:
	<ol type="1">
	   <li>	identify a 64MB block, many of whose 4K blocks are no longer in use.</li>
	   <li> copy the 4K blocks that are still in use into a new (densely filled)
	        64MB block, and update the resource allocation maps accordingly.</li>
	   <li> when no more valid data remains in the large block, it can be erased.</li>
	   <li> once the large block has been erased, all of the 4K blocks within it
	        can be added to the free list for reuse.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
   </li>
   <LI> Disk Space Allocation
        <p>
	File reads and writes can progress orders of magnitude more quickly if logically
	consecutive blocks are stored contiguously on disk (so they can be read in a
	single operation with no head movement).  But eventually, after many generations
	of files being created and deleted, the free space, and many files become
	discontiguous, and the file systems become slower and slower.
	</p>
   	<p>
	To clean up the free space and restore our previous performance, we need to follow
	a process that may seem a little bit like the game <em>Towers of Hanoi</em>, where
	moving anything seems to (recursively) require moving everything else:
	<ol type="1">
	   <li>	choose an area of the disk where we want to create contiguous free space and files. </li>
	   <li> for each file in that area, copy it to some other place, to free up space in the 
	        area we want to defragment.</li>
	   <li> after all files have been copied out of that area, we can coalesce all the free
	        space into one huge contiguous chunk. </li>
	   <li> choose a set of files to be moved into the newly contiguous free space, 
	        and copy them into it.</li>
	   <li> repeat this process until all of the files and free space are contiguous.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
   	A graphical illustration of this process can be seen in the 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defragmentation">Wikipedia article on Defragmentation</a>
   </li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
In neither of these examples is defragmentation a one-time process.  Internal fragmentation (like rust) never sleeps!
In the first (flash management) example the process is (like progressive garbage collection) a continuous one.
In older file systems (e.g. Windows FAT file systems), the process was more likely periodic; Once or twice a year 
we take the file system down to run defragmentation, after which performance should be good for a few more months.
But in some newer file systems (e.g. the B-TRee File System) defragmentation is also a continuously ongoing process.
</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<P>
If you write much interesting software, you are likely to find yourself allocating and managing some
sorts of divisible, serially reusable resources.  Garbage Collection and Defragmentation are 
sophisticated resource allocation strategies.  While the details of how to implement these 
strategies are highly dependent on the resources to be managed, the general concepts
can be applied to a surprisingly wide range of resource allocation problems:
<ul>
   <li>	If it does not make sense, or is not convenient to explicitly free resources, you should
   	consider whether or not Garbage Collection would be a simpler or more efficient solution.
	If you want to use Garbage Collection, you must figure out how you will make all referenced
	resources discoverable, how you will trigger the scans, and how you will prevent race
	conditions between the Garbage Collector and your application.</li>
   <li> If your resource is subject to degradation or loss due to external fragmentation, you 
   	should consider whether or not periodic defragmentation can mitigate that process.
	If you want to use Defragmentation, you must figure out how you will drive the
	process, and how you will accomplish the required resource reallocation and copying
	without disrupting the running applications.</li>
</ul>
